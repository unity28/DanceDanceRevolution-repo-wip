# Mod per DDRMM

After extracting the `.bin` files containing **.mdl** models and converting them into `.obj`, I noticed that in **Blender** they appear as a disorganized sequence of coordinates.  
To work around this issue, I decided to try exporting a 3D model with **the same number of vertices** into an `.obj`, then converting that file back into a `.bin` and adding it to the game files.

will likely leave this project in standby for now.

after consulting a member of the discord Blender community, ive found out a way to transform the .bin game files of the models into actual shapes. On a side note, it looks like the tools used are the same that get used by the MP5 modding community, so that was interesting. Still weird to think about the choice by Konami to adopt this type for each single gamefile, including 3d models.
